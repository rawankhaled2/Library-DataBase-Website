# Library-DataBase-Website

Document for IT332, Adevanced database.

Team work for making a library database.

The library is a joint information resource and meeting place for all students and researchers at each
University.
Here you will find literature and resources relevant to research and education at the university.

our point is that if you need to search for info, do it in the PHP code for more fun.
like:

$stmt=$conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM vBookStatus ");

$stmt->execute();

$result=$stmt->get_result();

echo"";


The website for the library:
